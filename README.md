- Communicate with repetition (I)
- Ensure visibility of work (newsletters, boards, exec reports, demos) (I)
- Conscious shift to async communication (C)

### Meetings
- Start and end rituals 
- Most meetings need to be recorded, and have transcripts
- Meetings can be asynchronous, long form threaded conversations (B)
- Don’t mix in-person and remote attendees (T)
- High fidelity and async → make screen share recordings with voiceover easy (C)
- Making meetings less abundant / more scarce, people make better use of the meeting time that does happen (C)
- Reducing meeting time comes with increased time spent on written communication (H) 

### Brainstorming 
- Use an online whiteboard 
- Dedicated time for folks to show off/share one thing they are working on (I)

### Timezones
- Ask questions publicly, not privately (B)
- Recommend 4 hours overlap (C)
- People need to be able to find anything they need w/o asking or waiting for someone else, i.e. most work needs to be possible async (C)

- If you pay top-band rates to every hiring market, you get an unfair hiring and retention advantage (C)
- Engineers: ask the candidate to do real work, and pay for it, versus a coding interview, see also contract to perm (C)
- Fully remote companies hire people %33 faster, and have 25% lower attrition (H)
